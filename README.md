# React.js Basics Project

## Overview
This is a basic React.js project that demonstrates the foundational concepts of React, including component creation, state management, props, and basic routing. The project is built using modern tools like Vite for fast development and TypeScript for type safety.

## Features
- **Functional Components**: Demonstrates the use of functional components in React.
- **State Management**: Uses the `useState` and `useEffect` hooks to manage state and lifecycle events.
- **Routing**: Implements basic navigation using React Router.
- **TypeScript**: Type safety and type checking for improved development experience.
- **Styling**: Basic styling using CSS modules and SCSS.
